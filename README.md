### Overview
This project involves analyzing a Netflix dataset using SQL to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about the content available on the platform. By leveraging SQL queries, the project explores various aspects of the Netflix catalog, including the type of content, release trends, and regional availability. The goal is to understand how Netflix has evolved over time and the types of content that dominate the platform.

### Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to use SQL to query and analyze the Netflix dataset, focusing on key insights such as content trends by genre, country, release year, and more. This project showcases the power of SQL for data analysis and highlights how it can be used to generate actionable insights from large datasets.
